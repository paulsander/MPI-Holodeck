To-Do List

IN PROGRESS:


LATER:
Add a discontinue/resume command to resume the last loaded program

Admin commands:
    Find missing details/succ/osucc messages
    How to add admin users - probably not useful without having actually configurable settings from this menu

Might be better to implement multiple column printing functions. col1print, col2print, and so on. Probably won't need very many.
    Can also have ones for different orientations. Col2printl, col2printr, etc.
    Should be more efficient than trying to do variable amounts.

    I also want the remainder items on the last row to distribute evenly, instead of sticking to a strict grid layout.
        I also kind of want a 3/1 row layout to display as 2 x 2 instead? Not sure how to manage the logic for that.
        I think that's the only case where it'd apply? Unless there was like, a 8/1 row split and I wanted to switch it to 3/3?
            I don't even know how useful it is to generalize this.
