To-Do List

IN PROGRESS:


LATER:
Add a discontinue/resume command to resume the last loaded program

Admin commands:
    Find missing details/succ/osucc messages
    How to add admin users - probably not useful without having actually configurable settings from this menu

Might be better to implement multiple column printing functions. col1print, col2print, and so on. Probably won't need very many.
    Can also have ones for different orientations. Col2printl, col2printr, etc.
    Should be more efficient than trying to do variable amounts.

    I also want the remainder items on the last row to distribute evenly, instead of sticking to a strict grid layout.
        I also kind of want a 3/1 row layout to display as 2 x 2 instead? Not sure how to manage the logic for that.
        I think that's the only case where it'd apply? Unless there was like, a 8/1 row split and I wanted to switch it to 3/3?
            I don't even know how useful it is to generalize this.

    Renaming exits/rooms is kind of onerous right now. Is there a way to make this better?
        You'd need to have some kind of throwaway ID for the directory prop, and then the full name after.
        Something like _holodeck/rooms/SomeProgramName/exits/blah/name:(N)orth;north;n

        * Thoughts: Maybe add some kind of 'render'/'bake' functionality to it can cache this info for easier access, instead of having to rescan everything every time?
            But there's some issues with that, of course. No way to tell it's up to date, requiring a user to do extra steps to install a program.

        * Corrolary idea: Some kind of name/prefix type thing? So you can install a pack from a given user and just run update scripts without clashing with other stuff? Hmmmm.

    Convey the action descs/icons better.
        Leave could maybe be a door icon.
