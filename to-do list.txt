To-Do List

IN PROGRESS:


LATER:
Add a discontinue/resume command to resume the last loaded program

Admin commands:
    Find missing details/succ/osucc messages
    Enable real exits mode + real exits dispatcher
        Also need a helper for renaming exits if I'm using this.
    How to add admin users - probably not useful without having actually configurable settings from this menu
